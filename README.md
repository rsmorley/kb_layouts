# My Custom keyboard layouts

### Kyria

* QWERTY layout
  
  deprecated layout that I no longer use

* RSTHD layout w/ home row mods

  this is a new layout that i'm trying. the RSTHD layout optimizes for putting the
  most common keys in the homerow and extends the home row by adding E to the
  thumb
  
### Corne

* the qmk compile command needs to include the convert flag
```zsh
qmk compile -kb crkbd -km rsmorley -e CONVERT_TO=rp2040_ce
```
* RSTHD layout w/ home row mods

  this is a new layout that i'm trying. the RSTHD layout optimizes for putting the
  most common keys in the homerow and extends the home row by adding E to the
  thumb

* I added a totoro animation that only moves while I type

### Kanata

* laptop keyboard layout
* adapted RSTHD layout to try to compensate for the lack of of thumb clusters and giant space bar
* home row mods
[!TODO] 
  * add navigation layer
  * look into kanata tray for easier toggling of custom map
